To solve the "Prime Game" problem, we need to break it down into several key components based on prime number generation, game theory, and algorithm optimization. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this:

Steps Breakdown:
Prime Numbers and Sieve of Eratosthenes:

We need an efficient way to determine prime numbers for each game round. This is where the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm becomes useful, as it can precompute all prime numbers up to the maximum number n in the rounds.
Game Mechanics:

Maria and Ben alternately pick prime numbers and remove them along with their multiples. The player who cannot pick any more prime numbers loses.
Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move.
Multiple Rounds:

The game is played x times, with different n values for each round. For each round, we need to determine the winner (Maria or Ben) and track the number of wins for each player.
Strategy:

Since Maria always goes first, we need to figure out which prime numbers can be chosen and how removing their multiples will affect the game.
Efficiency:

Since n and x can be large (up to 10,000), we need to precompute results efficiently and reuse them where possible to avoid recalculating for every round.
Plan:
Prime Number Calculation:

Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the largest n in nums.
Game Simulation:

For each n, simulate the game to determine the winner between Maria and Ben.
Counting Wins:

Keep track of how many rounds each player wins and return the player with the most wins.
